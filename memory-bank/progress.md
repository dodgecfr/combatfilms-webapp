# Progress: Initial Setup (April 7, 2025)

Summarizes what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions for the Combat Films & Research platform.

## What Works
- **Project Structure:** Monorepo (`pnpm`, `turbo`) is set up with `apps/web`, `apps/api`, and shared `packages`.
- **Core Technologies:** Next.js, TypeScript, Drizzle, Clerk, Tailwind CSS are integrated.
- **Basic Frontend:** The Next.js app (`apps/web`) likely runs and renders basic pages/UI components (`shadcn/ui`).
- **Basic API:** The API app (`apps/api`) structure exists, potentially with basic health checks or placeholder routes.
- **Memory Bank:** Core documentation structure is established.
- **Data Import Scripts:** Scripts exist (`scripts/`) for scraping/importing data, suggesting some data might be available statically.

## What's Left to Build / Verify
- **Feature Implementation:** Most core features need full implementation or verification:
    - E-commerce store functionality (product display, cart, checkout).
    - Payment integration (end-to-end PayPal flow).
    - User authentication flows (sign-up, sign-in, profile management).
    - Video streaming integration.
    - Content display for About, Our Work, Contact pages.
    - API endpoints for orders, payments, posts, etc.
- **Database Integration:** Verify database connection, schema accuracy (`packages/db/schema.ts`), and data seeding/migration status.
- **API Functionality:** Implement and test all required API endpoints and business logic.
- **Frontend-Backend Integration:** Ensure seamless data flow between `apps/web` and `apps/api`.
- **Deployment:** Configure and test Vercel deployment pipelines.
- **Testing:** Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Content Population:** Ensure all necessary text, images, and product data are correctly loaded and displayed.

## Current Status
- **Foundation Phase:** The basic project structure and core technology stack are in place. Initial analysis and documentation (Memory Bank) are complete.
- **Development Needed:** Significant development effort is required to implement and connect all features.

## Known Issues
- **Placeholder Data:** Many components and data files likely contain placeholder content (e.g., product details, descriptions).
- **Configuration:** Environment variables need to be correctly set up for all services (DB, Clerk, PayPal).
- **Incomplete Features:** Most user-facing features are likely incomplete or not yet functional.
- **API Implementation:** Specific backend logic for orders, payments, etc., needs implementation.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **(Initial) April 7, 2025:** Project analyzed, Memory Bank structure created and populated based on initial findings. Key technologies and architecture patterns identified. Decision to proceed with populating Memory Bank files based on analysis.
- **April 9, 2025:** Investigated failing PayPal checkouts for products with multiple options (e.g., Personal/Institutional, Hardcover/Paperback). Identified issue with how options (`on0`, `os0`) were being passed using the hosted button (`_s-xclick`) method. The hidden `<select>` element was likely not being submitted correctly due to being `disabled`. Implemented a fix in `apps/web/src/app/(marketing)/store/[category]/[id]/paypal-checkout.tsx` by:
    - Correcting the `on0` value for books to "Hardcover/Paperback".
    - Making the `os0` `<select>` elements active (removed `disabled`) but visually hidden using CSS positioning, ensuring their values are submitted with the form.
