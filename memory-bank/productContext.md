# Product Context: Combat Films & Research Platform

This document details the "why" behind the Combat Films & Research (CFR) web platform, the issues it addresses, its intended functionality, and the desired user experience.

## Purpose
- To create a dedicated, modern online platform for Combat Films & Research to showcase their extensive catalog of documentaries and other works (books, potentially archive documents).
- To provide a direct channel for audiences to purchase or access CFR content.
- To centralize information about the company, its mission, history, and services.

## Problems Solved
- **Outdated Online Presence:** The previous website (`combatfilms.com`) likely lacked modern features, design, and e-commerce capabilities.
- **Limited Accessibility:** Potential customers or viewers might have difficulty finding and accessing CFR's full catalog.
- **Manual Sales Process:** Selling media might have involved manual steps, hindering scalability and user convenience.
- **Fragmented Information:** Information about CFR and its work might have been scattered or hard to find.

## How It Should Work
- **Browsing & Discovery:** Users should be able to easily browse documentaries, books, and other content through categories, search, and potentially curated collections.
- **Product Details:** Each item should have a dedicated page with detailed descriptions, images/thumbnails, pricing (personal/institutional), and potentially trailers or previews.
- **E-commerce:** Users should be able to add items (DVDs, potentially digital access) to a cart and complete purchases securely via integrated payment methods (PayPal).
- **Streaming:** For certain documentaries, users might be able to stream directly via integrated video players (Vimeo, potentially others).
- **Information Hub:** The site should feature pages detailing CFR's history, mission, services, and potentially news or blog posts (`apps/api/src/modules/posts/`).
- **User Accounts:** Users might be able to create accounts (Clerk) to manage orders or access purchased digital content.

## User Experience Goals
- **Professional & Engaging:** The platform should reflect the quality and seriousness of CFR's work.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Users should find it easy to explore content and complete purchases.
- **Seamless Checkout:** The purchase process should be smooth and secure.
- **Accessible Content:** Information and media should be easily accessible across different devices.
- **Informative:** Users should easily learn about CFR and its mission.
